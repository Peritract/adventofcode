# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge. It's been running since 2015. 

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges. 

At the moment, the repository is mostly empty. I'm redoing my solutions because I've lost them all. It will update as and when I solve the puzzles again.

### Structure

Each challenge solution runs separately, without depending on any of the others. It would have been possible to simplify the code by making them all depend on each other and share code, but I think the key element of these challenges is to have a discrete solution for each one, rather than a more organised program without a clear purpose. 

All solution files can be run from the command line, and rely on a file named "input.txt" existing in the same folder.
